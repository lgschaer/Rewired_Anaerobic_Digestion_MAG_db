# Rewired Anaerobic Digestion MAG Database

MAGs from three samples sequenced at SeqCenter. Quality assessed with fastqc, trimmed with sickle, assembled with megahit, binned with metabat2, quality assessed with checkM2, annotated taxonomy with gtdb-tk, dereplicated with galah.

Processing scripts can be found in the "slurm" directory.

Overview of the taxonomy, quality, and assembly each MAG came from can be found in taxonomy_quality_HQ.MG.MAGs.csv

High and Medium quality MAGs resulting from this analysis can be found in MAG_db.tar.gz
